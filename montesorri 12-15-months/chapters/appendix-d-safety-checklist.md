## Remember

Safety in Montessori isn't about limiting exploration—it's about creating an environment where exploration is safe. Your child learns best through experience, but your job is ensuring those experiences don't include preventable injuries.

Trust your instincts. If something feels unsafe, it probably is. Adjust your environment as your child grows and develops new abilities. What was safe at 12 months may be dangerous at 18 months, and vice versa.

The goal: maximum freedom with minimum danger. Your prepared environment should say "yes" to exploration while keeping your child safe to explore another day.
