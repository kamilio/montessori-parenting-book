- Information structure
  - Theory immediately followed by practice
  - Progressive complexity (simple → complex)
  - Age-specific progressions (12, 13, 14, 15 months)

  - Problem-solution format throughout

- Evidence integration
  - Research statistics woven naturally (32% better, 700 synapses)
  - Scientific terms explained immediately
  - Neuroscience backing practical advice
  - Studies cited without academic heaviness

- Formatting patterns
  - Heavy use of bullet points and lists
  - Clear hierarchical headers
