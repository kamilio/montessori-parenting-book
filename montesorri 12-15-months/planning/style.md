  - Age-specific progressions (12, 13, 14, 15 months)
  - Week-by-week breakdowns for implementation
  - Problem-solution format throughout
  - Stories illustrate principles before explaining them

- Evidence integration
  - Research statistics woven naturally (32% better, 700 synapses)
  - Scientific terms explained immediately
  - Neuroscience backing practical advice
  - Studies cited without academic heaviness
  - Real-world examples before research citations

- Formatting patterns
  - Some bullet points, more flowing narrative
  - Clear hierarchical headers
